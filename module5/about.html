<p>
    I am Mariia, from Porvoo, Finland. I am married 
    and I have 2 adorable french bulldogs.
    Though I was born in Leningrad, Soviet Union, 
    I have been living in Finland more than 10 years, 
    and I hold Finnish citizenship. <br>
    Initially I came to Finland for studies. 
    I stayed for work and now Finland is my home. 
    In 2012 I graduated from Saimaa University of Applied Sciences 
    with Restaurant and Hotel Management bachelor degree. 
    I have been working in quite few places. 
    I have tried myself as a hotel receptionist, bartender and seller. 
</p>
<p> 
    Last year I realized I would like to try myself in IT industry 
    since it is one of the most fast growing and huge industry. 
    I have been working in customer service industry for more than 10 years 
    and I think it is time for me to try work with machines. 
    In January 2021 I got accepted into Haaga Helia UAS 
    for the Business Information Technology program.
</p>
<p>
    So far I enjoy studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
    I would love to become a professional Web developer. 
    I intend to proceed Software path in my studies. 
    Don't know whether I become successful in programming languages, but I will do my best!
